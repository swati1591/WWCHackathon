#Try something new

Do you ever get bored of doing the same stuff during your free time?

Have you ever found it difficult to think of something to do?

'Try something new' helps you find something new that you can do by suggesting a random activity
according to your interests.

Pick your interests and then click the button to find out what you will be doing today!

#Future scope
We can extend this to suggest events around you(Yelp,Google APIs). We can also have
a points system for every task that introduces a social aspect and you can challenge friends.
